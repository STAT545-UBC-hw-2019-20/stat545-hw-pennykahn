### Overview
This is the repository for my homework in **STAT 545** *Exploratory Data Analysis*. It will contain all of my assignments as they are completed throughout the term.

### A bit about me
I am a first-year PhD student in the Zoology department at UBC. I haven't narrowed in on a specific project yet, but some possibilities I am considering are:

* symbioses of marine protists and bacteria living in oxygen-deprived environments
* biodiversity and evolution of deep-sea meiofauna
* genomic and cellular adaptations to extreme environments
